\description{
Interpolate geo-referenced point data using inverse path distance weighting.
}
\details{
This is a high level function that interpolates a
SpatialPointsDataFrame object in a single pass.

Points must be located within a single contiguous area. The presence of "landlocked"
points will cause errors. It may be necessary to increase the value
assigned to land areas when using a large range value in combination
with a large sized cost rasters (grain x extent). In these cases, the
value of land areas should be increased to ensure that it is always
greater than the maximum accumulated cost path distance of any given geo-referenced point.
